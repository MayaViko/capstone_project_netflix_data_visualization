# Capstone_project_netflix_data_visualization

This is my project made on course of Data Visualization by Codecademy. The premise is that fictional financial analysts at Yahoo Finance! would like some visualizations for a stock profile of Netflix. The aim of the project was to study, visualize, analyse and plot data.

To complete this project I was using  Python 3.9.7 in addtion to Jupyter Notebook. Packages utilized include Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. All the data were provided by Codecadamy task file.

After creation of Netflix data visualizations, I created Google Presentation to outline the main results and conclusions of project. The presentation is included as "Capstone Project_ Netflix Stock Data Visualization.pdf"
